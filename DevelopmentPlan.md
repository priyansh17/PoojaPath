# Development Planning

- UI: Jetpack Compose with Material Design
- Backend: Ktor or Spring Boot (with Kotlin support)
- Database: PostgreSQL (or Firebase for realtime features)
- Authentication: Firebase Authentication or JWT
- Payment Gateway: Razorpay/Stripe
- Push Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
- Location Services: Google Maps API
- Analytics: Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics


# Next Tasks (decide stack):
1. Set up a Kotlin-based Android project using Jetpack Compose for the UI.
2. Implement backend using Ktor (if lightweight) or Spring Boot (if you need enterprise features).
3. Integrate PostgreSQL and Firebase for data storage.
4. Set up Firebase Authentication for user management and Stripe/Razorpay for payments.
5. Add Firebase Cloud Messaging for notifications and Google Maps for location-based services.
